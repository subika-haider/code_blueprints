        <h2>Writeup</h2>

        <h3>1. What have we done so far?</h3>
        <p>
            We’ve selected and cleaned our dataset, narrowing it down to the key columns relevant for mapping patient hospital journeys.
            We also created a simplified 3D hospital blueprint map using Spline, which visually represents the high-level stages of a typical hospital visit.
            The embedded 3D scene includes camera controls, allowing the user to rotate, zoom, and explore the hospital map.
            Additionally, we implemented a dropdown menu that allows the user to select from common reasons a patient might visit the hospital, setting the stage for condition-specific visualizations.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What will be the most challenging aspect of our project to design and why?</h3>
        <p>
            The most challenging part will definitely be designing more intricate 3D models. We have a vision for how we want our website to look and just achieving that will be most challenging for us.
            Creating specific visual representations for different hospital rooms while thinking about user experience,
            especially when working within the constraints of deadlines.
            Another anticipated challenge is implementing a symptom checker — in our final draft, we hope to allow users to input symptoms and predict a likely hospital path, which will require natural language handling and more complex condition mapping.
